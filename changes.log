# To do
* Figure out a better way to install
* Figure out a way to add new vaults (discovery and config editing)
* Figure out a way to install new vault-apps
* Should somehow run the workers for installed apps
* Should run a web server on a fixed port (vault port)
* Web server should show links to all installed apps
* Web server should receive triggers (through CORS support) to run a given worker

# 1.0 - 2013-09-24
* Run sentinel from cron, or from couch.ini's os_daemon section
* If run by CouchDB, will read ip/port from stdio
* Will connect to CouchDB, read sync config, and trigger replication
